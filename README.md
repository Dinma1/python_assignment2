This is a Python project showing fundamental list operations and methods.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive example of common Python list operations, including creation, modification, extension, sorting, and searching. It's designed as a learning tool for beginners to understand how lists work in Python.

## Features

- **List Creation**: Initialize empty lists
- **Element Addition**: Append and insert operations
- **List Extension**: Combining lists with extend()
- **Element Removal**: Remove elements using pop()
- **Sorting**: Arrange elements in ascending order
- **Searching**: Find element indices

## Code Structure

1. Create an empty list
2. Append multiple elements (10, 20, 30, 40)
3. Insert element at specific position (15 at index 1)
4. Extend list with another list ([50, 60, 70])
5. Remove the last element
6. Sort list in ascending order
7. Find index of specific element (30)


### Expected Output

```
Step 1 - Empty list: []
Step 2 - After appending 10, 20, 30, 40: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Step 3 - After inserting 15 at position 1: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
Step 4 - After extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
Step 5 - After removing the last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Step 6 - After sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Step 7 - Index of value 30: 3
```
